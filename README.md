# Personal Terminal-Based Website

Welcome to my personal website! This site is designed to mimic the look and feel of a terminal or command-line interface (CLI). It offers a unique, retro way to interact with my content. Whether you're a developer, a tech enthusiast, or just curious, I hope you'll enjoy exploring this unconventional space.

## Features

- Terminal Interface: The website emulates a command-line environment, complete with text-based commands and outputs. It's a nod to the classic days of computing, offering a nostalgic experience.

- Responsive Design: Despite its retro look, the website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktops only.

- Interactive Commands: Visitors can type commands to navigate through the site, access different sections, and discover hidden features.

## How to Use

1. Start: When you land on the homepage, you'll see a blinking cursor in a terminal window. Type help to get a list of available commands.

2. Navigation:
- about: Learn more about me and my journey.
- projects: View a list of my projects and including descriptions.
- contact: Find out how to get in touch with me.
- skills: Display programming skills.
